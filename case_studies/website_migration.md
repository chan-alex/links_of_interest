How we built GOV.UK without breaking the web - GitHub Satellite 2016  
- The main interesting part of this was how they handled the web link redirections  
  when they consolidation many UK gov sites to gov.uk.  
- This is something similar to C.NA revamp in 2017  
- Also interesting the wealth of real world code in the gov.uk github: https://github.com/alphagov/
